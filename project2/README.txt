My projects allows the user to add text to a photo using the Pillow Plugin. I built this off of the previous plugin lab we used. Rather than adding filters, I focused on the text aspect.
I used the Pillow tutorial located here to build my code: 

To use the code, you must download the code and the "puppy.jpg" photo. 
In some cases, the code can't find the path to the photo. I was able to fix this by opening up the puppy photo before running the code (it is an issue with windows and app data)

The terminal will prompt the user to enter in what text they want, and then will open the photo with the text added.
