the project1 scripts imports the date and time from the virutal machine. I created a new variable equal to the 
current date and time so that it could be outputted to the user.
I structured the date and time so it was easier to read. 
By pressing run the terminal outputs the time and date from the virtual machine. No input is needed from the user. 

I learned about the python now() attribute and about python date and time from here :
