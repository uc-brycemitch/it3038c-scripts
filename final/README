README

My project uses the flask app to generate a mad libs story for the user. It builds off Lab11, but makes it a bit more interactive.
It takes input from the user using a form, and then it ouputs it in the form of a mad lib story. 


For my final, you need to download everything within the final folder (routes.py, web.py, and the templates folder)
Do not remove anything from the templates folder, they need to remain in that folder to work. 

########## BEFORE RUNNING ##########

You will need to install flask:
In the command prompt enter

py -3 -m venv venv

venv\Scripts\activate.bat

pip install flask

python web.py
#before python web.py you will need to cd to the directory that you downloaded it to#

########## AFTER FLASK INSTALL ##########

In Visual Studio, in order for the code to work, you must choose a python interpreter. 
Hit CTRL+T and enter ">Python: Select Interpreter"
From there, you will have to select a new path, not the one provided.
Click "Find..."
Navigate to the path C:\Users\Administrator\venv\Scripts\flask

After that, you can navigate to localhost:5000 in the browser and it will ask you to input information. 
After that, click submit and the mad libs story appears.
