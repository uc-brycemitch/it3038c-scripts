Pillow is used to edit images. This is the tutorial I used to learn how to navigate Pillow: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python_pillow/python_pillow_quick_guide.htm
I used a picture of a puppy to test pillow. First I opened the initial photo, then I blurred it, then I rotated it, and finally I imported filters to apply to it. To run my code, you just need to have the picture of the puppy and the lab7 file in the same directory. 

INSTALLING PILLOW:
First, I made sure that python had an environment variable path on my machine (does not work otherwise). 
Then, I went into the command prompt and typed in the following commands (pip is already installed with new python versions):
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install --upgrade Pillow
